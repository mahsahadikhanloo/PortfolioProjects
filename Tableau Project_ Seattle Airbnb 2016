The Airbnb dataset for 2016 provides information on the various listings on the Airbnb platform. One interesting aspect of the data is the comparison of the average price by room type. In this report, we will look at the average price of room types ranging from 0 to 6.
Starting with the smallest room type, the average price of a room type 0, which is typically a private room in a shared space, is $105.2. Moving up to room type 1, which is a private room in an entire apartment or house, the average price slightly declines to $96.2. For room type 2, which is a whole apartment or house, the average price jumps to $175.4.
When looking at larger room types, the average price continues to increase. Room type 3, which is typically a multi-bedroom apartment or house, has an average price of $249.7. Room type 4, which is usually a large house or villa, has an average price of $315.4. Room type 5, which could be a mansion or castle, has an average price of $450.0. Finally, room type 6, which includes unique spaces such as treehouses or igloos, has an average price of $584.8.
We can see that the number of houses with only one bedroom is far higher than that of the whole other houses. It means the houses with one bedroom are in high demand in comparison to other houses.
Also we can see an ever-increasing trend for the revenue in year 2016. Regardless of the specific reasons, an increasing revenue over time is generally seen as a positive indicator of business success and can contribute to long-term growth and profitability.
In conclusion, the Airbnb data for 2016 shows a clear trend of increasing average price as the bedrooms increase in size and luxury. This information can be useful for hosts to determine the optimal listing price for their space, and for travelers to budget accordingly for their accommodations.
