Analyzing COVID-19 Datasets with SQL Server: Gaining insights into the pandemic through data-driven queries.
Get data set from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .
The purpose of this SQL Project is to analyze COVID-19 datasets related to deaths and vaccinations. The datasets contain information on the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, the population of various countries, etc. The queries help us understand:
•	Total cases vs total deaths.
•	Total cases vs population.
•	The highest infection rate compared to population.
•	The likelihood of dying if anyone contracts COVID-19.
•	What percentage of the population got COVID-19. 
•	The countries with the highest infection rate and death count per population.
•	The percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated.
•	Global Numbers.
•	Total Population vs Vaccination.
I also created a view to store the combined data for later visualizations.
